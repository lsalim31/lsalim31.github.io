This is a website to store some of my main projects throughout my sophomore/senior year in UC Berkeley. Consider this an extended version of my [resume](https://github.com/lsalim31/lsalim31.github.io/blob/main/Paper.pdf) focused in my academic life. The website is separated by areas of studies, but each project is not limited to just one area. At the end, one can also find more [about me](https://lsalim.github.io/About-Me).


## Machine Learning & Data Science

### Pacman AI
- Coded a entire game of pacman that is fully automated using reinforcement learning. We simultaneously considered both agents: the pacman (usually a rational human player) and the ghosts (usually random). One of the best simple applications of [Gradient Descent optimatizaion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).  


### Breast Cancer Cohort
- Designed a Random Forest model that predicts chances of high vs low survival period for [patients with breast cancer](http://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric) with an accuracy of 82%; discovered individual genes crucial to such biological system.


## Computer Science

### Personal Version Control System 
- Built a version control system from scratch that simulates all major qualities of Git (init, add, commit, remove, log, branch, merge, etc). Used hidden folders to store previous commits, and the graph data structure combined with hash ids as file names to represent the commit log.

### Generalized version of the Enigma Machine
- Complete break down of mechanism of the [Enigma Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) (used in WWII) and translation of such understanding into the language of classes in Object Oriented Programming. 



## Mathematics

### The Bridge Between Propositional Logic And Set Theoritic Expressions
- Wrote this <a href="lsalim31.github.io/main/paper.pdf" target="_blank"> paper.</a> that connects two similar fields of mathematics through a very simple argument based on the isomorphism between the groups of integers mod2 and the powerset.  


### Analytic Number Theory on Riemann Hypothesis
- Investigated the distribution of zeros from the Riemann zeta function; contributed to [Dr. Jesse Elliot‚Äôs](https://www.csuci.edu/news/spotlights/faculty/mathematician-philosopher.htm) "Analytic Number Theory and The Iterated Logarithm" book with unique mathematical visualizations. 


### Theoretical analysis on the betas of portfolio risk minimization (Finance)
- Derived theoretical results that connects the strength of the leading eingenvalue of the covariance matrix to the averege correlation between features in a High parameter dimension scheme. This has direct consequences to the use of betas in analytical portfolio managenment. This <a href="lsalim31.github.io/main/paper.pdf" target="_blank"> paper.</a> by Goldberg is the starting point for this research. 



# üí´ About Me:
I am a senior UC Berkeley undergraduate majoring in Applied Mathematics (cluster in Data Science). The power Mathematics have on real world problems amazes me everyday; the more I learn about the world, the more I see use for this surprising subject. Indeed, I love solving practical problems, but I also delight in doing mathematics for its own sake; being analytical about my creativity is the perfect combination between the rational and irrational. I also love when pure becomes applied; to walk on the bridge between theory and practice. My passion about knowledge is not limited to math; I also love to learn Physics, Computer Science, Data Science, and Economics (specially when those are integrated with math). I am very curious about the world, and one of my favorite things is to simply learn something new (not limited to the academic life). For instance:
- Sports: Soccer, Table Tennis, Tennis, and Bowling are a few of my favorites to explore.
- Music: I play the piano for more than 10 years (and the guitar for more than 7 years), and I am constantly looking for new stories to tell through harmony: composing is a beautiful place to let my creativity come to life.
