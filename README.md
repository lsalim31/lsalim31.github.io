## Mathematics

### The Bridge Between Propositional Logic And Set Theoritic Expressions
- Wrote this [paper](/paper.pdf) that connects two similar fields of mathematics through a very simple argument based on the notion of a group isomorphism. Abstract:
> We consider the isomorphism between the groups $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$ and $\mathscr{P}(X)$, for any set $X$ with cardinality $n$. We investigate how this can be useful to see propositional logic through the lenses of set theory (and vice-versa), and prove some interesting consequences that connect both fields. 


### Analytic Number Theory on Riemann Hypothesis
- Investigated the distribution of zeros from the Riemann zeta function; contributed to [Dr. Jesse Elliotâ€™s](https://www.csuci.edu/news/spotlights/faculty/mathematician-philosopher.htm) "Analytic Number Theory and The Iterated Logarithm" book with unique mathematical visualizations. 


### Theoretical analysis on the betas of portfolio risk minimization (Finance)
- Derived theoretical results that connects the strength of the leading eingenvalue of the covariance matrix to the averege correlation between features in a High dimension scheme. This has direct consequences to the use of betas in analytical portfolio managenment.


## Computer Science

### Personal Version Control System 
- Built a version control system from scratch that simulates all major qualities of Git (init, add, commit, remove, log, branch, merge, etc). Used hidden folders to store previous commits, and the graph data structure combined with hash ids as file names to represent the commit log.

### Generalized version of the [Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)
- Complete break down of mechanism of the Enigma cypher (used in WWII) and translation of such understanding into the language of classes in Object Oriented Programming.


## Machine Learning & Data Science

### Pacman AI
- Coded a entire game of pacman that is fully automated using reinforcement learning. We simultaneously considered both agents: the pacman (usually a rational human player) and the ghosts (usually random). One of the best simple applications of [Gradient Descent optimatizaion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).  


### Breast Cancer Cohort
- Designed a Random Forest model that predicts chances of high vs low survival period for [patients with breast cancer](http://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric) with an accuracy of 82%; discovered individual genes crucial to such biological system.
